## 4. Project Structure

```txt
gasfree-client/
├── src/
│   └── GasFreeService.php         # PHP SDK client
├── sign-server.js                 # Local signing server
├── run.php                        # CLI entry
├── .env                           # Your secrets (not committed)
├── composer.json
├── package.json
└── README.md                      # This file
```

---

## 5. Usage: CLI Transfer (run.php)

Use the CLI script to send gasless transfers:

```bash
php run.php –receiver=TXYZ… –amount=5 [–dry-run]
```

- `–receiver` — TRON address to send to
- `–amount` — Amount in USDT
- `–dry-run` — Simulate without sending

Examples

```bash
# Dry run
php run.php –receiver=TXYZ123… –amount=1 –dry-run

# Live transfer
php run.php –receiver=TXYZ123… –amount=1
```

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add transaction status checker
- Dockerize client & signer and turn into API
